# Python Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game written in Python.

## What It Does:
- You have 3 chances to guess a secret number.
- If your guess is correct, you win.
- If not, you lose after 3 attempts.

## What I Learned:
- while loops
- if-else conditions
- Taking user input and comparing it

## Why I Made This:
This is my first real Python project. It may be small, but it's part of a much bigger journey I'm building for myself.

## My Korea Plan (TCS Dream):
- Studying BTech Artificial Intelligence & Data Science
- Goal: Work at TCS Chennai, then transfer to TCS Korea
- Learning Python step by step as part of the journey

This repository is part of my personal and professional journey.
